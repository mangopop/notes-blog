## Turns out WSL2 can lose internet with certain VPN configurations

Running this in powershell, if internet not working to get internet back in wsl2
{% highlight powershell %}
Get-NetAdapter | Where-Object {$_.InterfaceDescription -Match "Cisco AnyConnect"} | Set-NetIPInterface -InterfaceMetric 6000
{% endhighlight %}

Make the packet size bigger/smaller, mine was 1500 so lowered it just a bit
{% highlight bash %}
sudo ip link set eth0 mtu 1355
{% endhighlight %}

get it with
{% highlight bash %}
ip a | grep mtu
{% endhighlight %}
