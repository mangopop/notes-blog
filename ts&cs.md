Oh shit, you're here!? Grab a cup of T and a biscuit or some crisps, you have had some crisps already? Get some more. Or maybe a pot of kimchi, just on its own, I can’t stop eating the stuff, it’s like catnip for me. Just remember to do some sit ups to work all off.

- **Disclaimer of Responsibility:** Look this isn’t about food; this is legal beagle stuff. Let me guide you on what happens when you read anything without a dose of salt. Don’t worry, it’s all sorted because I’m legally covering my ass. Read on.

- **Use at Your Own Risk:** Go ahead, roll the dice with my advice (huh, that rhymed). But don't be shocked if your code accidentally removes GCP installations in multiple regions across the world. You've been warned.

- **Intellectual Property:** The nuggets of wisdom you find here are like precious gems mined from the depths of my failing brain. Share 'em, and don’t credit me, I didn’t do it, I’ve never had an original thought in my life. Plagiarism is abundantly common; steal away.

- **Third-Party Links:** Oh, you want to click on that link, do you? Well, go ahead, but don't blame me if you’ve just installed spyware from an Indian call centre in Bangladesh. Ok do, but you still can’t sue me.

- **Indemnification:** By graciously accepting my sage advice, you're basically absolving me of any responsibility for the chaos that may ensue. Your code doesn’t delete all files named ‘sausage-party-in-beford.mov’ but deletes the root folder? Not my circus, not my monkeys.

- **Jurisdiction and Governance:** These terms and conditions are governed by the laws of the United Kingdom in all their holy glory, long live the King. Jurisdiction, your place or mine. Disputes? Let's settle them with a game of - first one to blink loses.

- **Changes to Terms:** I reserve the right to switch things up whenever the mood strikes. I frequently change the titles more than anything. But if I said something, then said something else, the latter is correct 60% of the time, all the time.

By sticking around and indulging in the wonderland that is Mangopops Majestic Matrix, you're giving me the nod of approval to keep doing posting this utterly useless pap. Bless you.
